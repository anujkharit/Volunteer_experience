I am a highly-trained storyteller, specializing in early childhood literacy development. As a certified minibiblioPLUS story-time animator, I have honed my skills in effectively communicating the benefits of early childhood literacy to parents, children, educators, and the general community. 
With a passion for storytelling and a deep understanding of the impact it has on child development, I engage audiences through captivating narratives and interactive activities.
My dedication to promoting literacy has been recognized through the awarding of my certification. 
I am now seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise in creating enriching and educational story-time experiences for children that foster a love for reading and learning.
